## Abstract

We will consider the affects of various playing surfaces in tennis tournaments hosted by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). Ivestigating this topic is important becuase we can potentially uncover hidden patterns and new avenues for optimizing player
performance. Accordingly, we plan to identify trends, predict match
outcomes, and deliver a comprehesnive summary of the factors influencing player success.

## Keywords

Association of Tennis Professionals, win rate, player ranking, 

## Proposal

1. Introduction  

> This project investigates the influence different playing surfaces has on player performance in the context of the Association of Tennis Professionals. 
Through our analysis we ask ourselves - is possible to predict the trajectory of a particular tennis player’s ranking based on historical data? This data will support statistics in match viewing popularity, player marketability, and tournament pools, all of which are integral to the tennis industry. Carefully applying these metrics to future events is likely to provide quality entertainment for the audience and increased revenue for the organization and or the individual player. Furthering the questions surrounding potential player success, we also wonder, how do the win rates of two tennis players, measured over a series of matches within a specific tournament, differ, and is there a significant variance in their performance? With this, we are able to evaluate relative strengths and abilities through win rates. Thus, allowing for direct comparisons between players, aiding in the assessment of their skill levels and competitiveness within the sport. Finally, and most importantly we want to know, Is there a statistically significant relationship between a tennis player’s performance and the type of surface they play on? Knowing this can contribute to answering our initial question surrounding player performance. If a player does particularly well on a specific surface we can use this as a parameter in considering a single match outcome between two opponents or an entire season for a single player.

3. The Dataset

>The dataset we’re investigating will be the “ATP Tennis Matches 2013-2023” CSV file available on Kaggle. This data collection contains information about every ATP tennis match (ATP 250, 500, Masters 1000, Grand Slam) that occurred between the years of 2013 and 2023. This includes various attributes such as tournament name, surface type, match date, player names, their rankings, match scores, etc. The data was collected simply by a fan (user DISSFYA on Kaggle) who was invested in collecting popular tennis match/player statistics, and who published such findings with a Creative Commons license so that it could be accessed in the public domain.There are 17 features/columns in this data, some of which were aforementioned above. There are 25,163 rows, which represent a single match at a tournament and the respective characteristics and aspects of the match. As a result of the way in which this data was obtained, one possible limitation to consider is that the individual who found and collected this data might have looked over certain matches/data points (which is unlikely given the thoroughness of the data). Additionally, they also would have had the power to insert personal biases towards a player, tournament, etc through including more relevant data pertaining to these items rather than objectively adding data pertaining to any potential data point to consider. This, however, A challenge we faced with this data is that, if a match never played out, ended due to injury, involved a retired player, etc, the row which was relevant to this match was simply wiped clean. Therefore, we had to scan through the data and remove any blank rows manually, which was quite laborious and difficult.
