## Abstract

We will consider the affects of various playing surfaces in tennis tournaments hosted by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). Ivestigating this topic is important becuase we can potentially uncover hidden patterns and new avenues for optimizing player
performance. Accordingly, we plan to identify trends, predict match
outcomes, and deliver a comprehesnive summary of the factors influencing player success.

## Keywords

Association of Tennis Professionals, win rate, player ranking, 

## Proposal

1. Introduction  

> This project investigates the influence different playing surfaces has on player performance in the context of the Association of Tennis Professionals. 
Through our analysis we ask ourselves - is possible to predict the trajectory of a particular tennis player’s ranking based on historical data? This data will support statistics in match viewing popularity, player marketability, and tournament pools, all of which are integral to the tennis industry. Carefully applying these metrics to future events is likely to provide quality entertainment for the audience and increased revenue for the organization and or the individual player. Furthering the questions surrounding potential player success, we also wonder, how do the win rates of two tennis players, measured over a series of matches within a specific tournament, differ, and is there a significant variance in their performance? With this, we are able to evaluate relative strengths and abilities through win rates. Thus, allowing for direct comparisons between players, aiding in the assessment of their skill levels and competitiveness within the sport. Finally, and most importantly we want to know, Is there a statistically significant relationship between a tennis player’s performance and the type of surface they play on? Knowing this can contribute to answering our initial question surrounding player performance. If a player does particularly well on a specific surface we can use this as a parameter in considering a single match outcome between two opponents or an entire season for a single player.
