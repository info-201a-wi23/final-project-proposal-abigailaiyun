### Authors

Names of your team members and contact information (email addresses).

### Date

Winter 2023

## Abstract

No more than three sentences that summarize your project. Focus on the very most important aspects. For example: (1) "Our main question is .... This question is important because .... To address the question, we will ...." (2) "We are concerned with ..., because .... To address this concern, we plan to ...." (3) "Consider that .... This is important because .... Accordingly, we plan to ...."

## Keywords

3-5 keywords that summarize your project.
(e.g., "Keywords: human physiology; bicycle exercise; Gen Z; times-series data")

## Proposal

1. Introduction  

> Briefly introduce your project.  Include 3-5 research questions. What motivates the questions? Why are they important? (at least 200 words)

2. Related Work  

> Describe your topic and related work in this space. You must include 3 citations to related work (URLs to similar work, high quality articles from the popular press, research papers, etc. ) Please use a standard citation style of your choice. (at least 200 words)

3. The Dataset

> The dataset we’re investigating will be the “ATP Tennis Matches 2013-2023” CSV file available on Kaggle. This data collection contains information about every ATP tennis match (ATP 250, 500, Masters 1000, Grand Slam) that occurred between the years of 2013 and 2023. This includes various attributes such as tournament name, surface type, match date, player names, their rankings, match scores, etc.
>
> The data was collected simply by a fan (user DISSFYA on Kaggle) who was invested in collecting popular tennis match/player statistics, and who published such findings with a Creative Commons license so that it could be accessed in the public domain.
>
> There are 17 features/columns in this data, some of which were aforementioned above. There are 25,163 rows, which represent a single match at a tournament and the respective characteristics and aspects of the match.
>
> As a result of the way in which this data was obtained, one possible limitation to consider is that the individual who found and collected this data might have looked over certain matches/data points (which is unlikely given the thoroughness of the data). Additionally, they also would have had the power to insert personal biases towards a player, tournament, etc through including more relevant data pertaining to these items rather than objectively adding data pertaining to any potential data point to consider. This, however, 
>
> A challenge we faced with this data is that, if a match never played out, ended due to injury, involved a retired player, etc, the row which was relevant to this match was simply wiped clean. Therefore, we had to scan through the data and remove any blank rows manually, which was quite laborious and difficult.
